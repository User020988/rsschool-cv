2. My goal is to become Junior Developer at first. Then I will improove my skills by myself, because nobody gonna teach you at work.  I want to create web based apps.  
I always need to learn something, so i have some abilities to learn fast and work hard. At first I will Junior, so I'm ready.  

3. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.) I think that the main tool is a brain, then how can you make data scouting and the practice. IT and webdev sphere is new for me, so I'm in RS school course of JS. I will update my "4. Skills" later.

4. Now i don't have any code examples. I will add it soon.

5. I created [a5comics](http://a5comics.ru). Marketplace with comics from russian indi authors.

6. I will update it soon

7. In 2007 i was in USA about 6 month. At that time i had intermediate level of my English. At that time I think the level is pre-intermediate, but i can improove it back to intermediate.
